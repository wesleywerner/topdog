    "If you get thirsty running around, stand on some water to [d]rink (keypad DIV).\nIf you get hungry, pick up some food and [e]at it (keypad MUL).\nOnce you have to [p]iddle, stand next to something interesting for extra points ;)"
    "Now go find the mouse, to learn how to quests work... Good luck!\n^_^"

"Hi Top Dog, I am Julie the mouse. Can you help me?"

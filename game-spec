================================[[ 7-Day Roguelike 2012 Game Specification ]]

TopDog is a Roguelike style game. The Puppy has been kidnapped by the 
Fat Cat Mafioso. You travel from yard to yard, searching for the 
crafty Cats holding her hostage. Along the way you meet other animals, 
and perhaps a bone or two on the way.

===============================================================[[ Timeline ]]

Day 5: Quest system

Day 6: Bug testing, UI polish and balancing

Day 7: Saved for Murphey's Law

=========================================================[[ Technical Spec ]]

Minimalism and fun, is the primary goal. Replayability is a given, with a 
low learning curve. To achive this, some classic RL mechanics are simplified, 
and complimentary Role Playing elements are introduced:

- A coffee-break Roguelike that can be played in no time

- walk into things to act on them: friends will start dialogue, 
foes will be attacked, items will be picked up. 
ranged attacks are moot (unless fido grows opposable thumbs)

- simplified inventory: carry one item in your mouth. 
stepping over a second item will swap them out (prompt to swap?)

- no HP / life system, instead we opt for a flee mechanism. 
The defeated will then refuse to approach the victor, at least until after a 
rest period. If you do get cornered while in defeat mode, your life may just end.

- You get thirsty every x moves, and quench your thirst with water. 
Has the side-effect that you need to piddle too, 
to your advantage this gives bonus points ;)

- Some NPC's can have quest items linked to them, 
these give us rewards and points.

- drop food near hostiles to lure them away (strategic cartesian space puzzles)

- each level fits on one screen, no scrolling minimap

- you move from one yard to another through holes in the fence

- dialogue is shown in a nice little window

- biscuits are yummy

===========================================================[[ Animal NPC's ]]

the friendliness of a character is measure on a scale from dead to breathing:

- skittish: runs when approached
- neutral: 50/50 friendly or hostile
- friendly: approachable, may offer quests
- cheeky: 70/30 chance hostility
- hostile: these want your blood

(s)quirrel: skittish
(c)at: cheeky
fat (C)at: hostile. sticks near where the food is.
(h)uman kid: friendly
(H)uman: neutral
(b)ird: skittish. can fly off the map.
(d)uck: neutral. appears near water.
(p)eacock: cheeky
(r)ooster: cheeky. targets seeds
(m)onkey: cheeky. appears in trees. targets most food.

=================================================================[[ Quests ]]

- linked to a NPC on a level, these items can be placed randomly or near
    another NPC of a certain type (for keeping to RPG stories)

- only friendly NPC's carry quests

List some quest stories here:

===================================================================[[ Maps ]]

To match our theme, we opt for pre-built map templates, upon which we layer 
water, bushes, NPC's and exit-holes. 
Level persistence is moot: we can't enter the hole we last used 
(we can't go back, a Puppy needs rescuing!)

- for variance, we can transform maps by flipping them on the cartesian plane.

- map placement order: base, plants, animals, humans, quest items
